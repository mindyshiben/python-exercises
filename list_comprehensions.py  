# 17 list comprehension problems in python


fruits = ['mango', 'kiwi', 'strawberry', 'guava', 'pineapple', 'mandarin orange']
numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 256, -8, -4, -2, 5, -9]
numbers_plus_one = [number + 1 for number in numbers]

print(numbers_plus_one)



# Example code that creates a list of all of the list of strings in fruits and uppercases every string
output = [] 
for fruit in fruits:
    output.append(fruit.upper())
    
# Exercise 1 - rewrite the above example code using list comprehension syntax. Make a variable named uppercased_fruits to hold the output of the list comprehension. Output should be ['MANGO', 'KIWI', etc...]

# Exercise 2 - create a variable named capitalized_fruits and use list comprehension syntax to produce output like ['Mango', 'Kiwi', 'Strawberry', etc...]

# Exercise 3 - Use a list comprehension to make a variable named fruits_with_more_than_two_vowels. Hint: You'll need a way to check if something is a vowel.

# Exercise 4 - make a variable named fruits_with_only_two_vowels. The result should be ['mango', 'kiwi', 'strawberry']

# Exercise 5 - make a list that contains each fruit with more than 5 characters

# Exercise 6 - make a list that contains each fruit with exactly 5 characters

# Exercise 7 - Make a list that contains fruits that have less than 5 characters
